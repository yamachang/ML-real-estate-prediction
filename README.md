Can we build a model to better predict transaction prices of real estate prices?
```

## üí° Business Background

In a bid to modernize their property valuation process, a leading Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) based in a small county in New York state launched an ambitious initiative. Their goal: to construct a data-driven real estate pricing model that accurately predicts the fair transaction price of properties before their sale, maintaining an updated understanding of the market's ebbs and flows.

The REIT engaged my services as a data science consultant, presenting me with the challenge of developing a model capable of predicting transaction prices with an average error of less than $70,000. To aid in this mission, they offered an unused dataset from 2016 containing the transaction prices of properties in the REIT's area of operation.

## üìà Machine Learning Background

* The dataset has 1883 observations in the county where the REIT operates.
* Each observation is for the transaction of one property only.
* Each transaction was between $200,000 and $800,000.
* Target Variable: Transaction Price
* Input Features: 22 independent variable including `Public records for the property`, `Property characteristics`, `Location convenience scores`, `Neighborhood demographics`, `Schools`
* Machine Learning Task: Regression
* Win Condition: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) < $70,000

## üöÄ Getting Started

Initiate the process by establishing an appropriate environment for running a Jupyter Notebook file, making certain that you have the right versions of all required libraries. Following this, proceed to download the data and the .ipynb file. Load the necessary libraries and data in the notebook. Finally, execute the entire notebook by selecting "Run All".
